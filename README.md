# Ordinata (proof of concept)

**This project is in active development, has not been tested or benchmarked, and the API is likely to change
considerably before stable launch. Please do not use in any production projects at this time.**

Ordinata is a utility belt for transforming arrays whilst maintaining identity equality in more circumstances. This can
be useful for tools like reselect, where maintaining identity equality between calls can improve performance.
